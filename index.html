        <h2>This is a dog</h2>
        <h3>Specifically a German Shepherd</h3>
        <p>The reason it was this breed of dog is because it was the first type of dog I ever had.</p>
        <p>All dog breeds are great though. Some of my favourites are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Shepherd">Australian Shepherds</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog">Bernese Mountain Dogs</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever">Labradors</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are so many others that are awesome that I don't even know the name of.</p>
